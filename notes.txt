looping statements:
-to execute the block of code repeatedly.
for loop:executed when we know exact iteration count.
syntax:for(intialization;condition;updation){
}
while:executed whenwe dont know the number of iterations.
while(condition){
    }
do while:
do{
}
while(condition){
}

-entry controlled loops:for and while
-exit control loops:do while.

function:
-function is a block of code used to execute specific task assigned to code
-function is a non-primitive datatype
-function can be reusable.

syntax:function function_name(optional parametres){
                //Statements
                }
                function_name(arguments);
-a value in function is known as arguments.
Types of function:
1.Named function
2.Anonymous function
3.Function Expression
4.Immediate invoke function Expression(IIFE):CAlled only once
5.Arrow function
6.Higher order function
-- A function which accepts another function as an argument.
7.Callback function:which is passed as an argument to hof function.
--closure:It is a memory  where functions are bundled together or nested each other by giving an accesibility to the innermost fun to acces the variability to outermost function.

1.Named Function:
-function which is defined with name and invoked with same name
2.Anonymous Function:
-function which does not have a name to declare and to invoke.
-cannot be executed for itself.
3.Function Expression:
-anonymous function body or declaration is assigned and invoked with the same variable
4.Immediate invoke function Expression(IIFE):
-once the function is crested imeediately it should be invoked.
5.Arrow function:
-es6:ECMA Scripts
Europian computer Manufacturing association:handles updation related to js
current version:es14
-es6 is a stable version.
-syntax:()=>{};
