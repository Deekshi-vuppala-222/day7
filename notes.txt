-to execute the block of code repeatedly.

syntax:for(intialization;condition;updation){
}
while:executed whenwe dont know the number of iterations.
while(condition){
    }
do while:
do{
}
while(condition){
}

-entry controlled loops:for and while
-exit control loops:do while.

function:
-function is a block of code used to execute specific task assigned to code
-function is a non-primitive datatype
